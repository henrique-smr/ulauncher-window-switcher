## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

I wanted to have an alternative way to switch among different open windows besides using <code>alt+tab</code>. Also, I love using Ulauncher for many things, so I though it would be a good idea to make the window switch by just typing a keyword for it. And I've also been thinking about making any extension that can be used with Ulauncher.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

If you don't already have [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) installed, you can download it from [here](https://ulauncher.io/#Download).

### Installing

After installing, Open Ulauncher Preferences.

Then, click "Add Extension" link:

![Installation steps](./images/install.gif)

Insert this repo url on the `"Enter Extension URL"` dialog and click `"Add"`:

```
https://github.com/trepichio/ulauncher-window-switcher
```

Done! 🎉


## 🔧 Issue after adding extension <a name = "issue"></a>

If you see the extension listed after adding it, it's probably working. But if you see an error message, click the `Reload the list` and check if the error message is gone. It should be enough to fix the issue.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

You can trigger the window switcher extension by typing the <code>s + space</code> default keyword on Ulauncher then any other keyword describing an open window you want to switch to.

You can change to whatever you want by editing the `keyword` property in the extension's properties.
